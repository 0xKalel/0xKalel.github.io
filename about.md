# About Me

## Professional Background

I'm Khalil Hebachi, a Lead Full-Stack Engineer with over 12 years of experience designing and building high-performance web applications. I've worked across diverse industries including SaaS, e-commerce, and logistics, architecting scalable solutions that handle real-world complexity.

Currently, I serve as Lead Developer at Storagepal, where I oversee development across two major platforms:
- A NEOS Flow (PHP) based system
- A modern React + Laravel + Inertia.js stack with PWA offline-first architecture

My work spans the full development lifecycle—from database schema design and system architecture to component development and performance optimization. Recently, I delivered an enterprise WMS solution that achieved 99%+ processing improvements while leading cross-functional teams to exceed delivery timelines.

## Technical Expertise

### Frontend Development
- **Frameworks**: React, Vue.js, modern reactive UI patterns
- **State Management**: Redux, Context API, Zustand
- **UI/UX**: Component architecture, design systems, responsive design
- **Performance**: Code splitting, lazy loading, optimization techniques

### Backend Development
- **Languages**: PHP, Node.js, JavaScript/TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Laravel, NEOS Flow, Hono
- **Architecture**: Microservices, monoliths, API design
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis

### Modern Web Technologies
- **PWAs**: Service workers, offline-first architecture
- **Local-First**: ElectricSQL, PGlite, Drizzle ORM
- **Web3**: Blockchain integration, decentralized apps
- **Security**: CASL, PostgreSQL RLS, defense-in-depth models

## AI-Assisted Development

I'm deeply passionate about the intersection of AI and software development. I actively explore and implement AI-first development methodologies:

- **Prompt Engineering**: Crafting effective prompts for LLMs to accelerate development
- **AI Workflows**: Building Markdown-driven pipelines for tracking progress and orchestrating AI tools
- **Multi-LLM Integration**: Working with multiple AI APIs while optimizing for cost and token usage
- **Agent Systems**: Designing and implementing autonomous agent workflows
- **MCP Servers**: Custom Model Context Protocol servers for enhanced AI capabilities

I use tools like Claude Code extensively and have developed unique workflows that integrate structured data (JSON/MD) directly into the engineering process. My focus is on making coding workflows smarter, faster, and more reproducible.

## Development Philosophy

I believe in:
- **Pragmatic architecture**: Building solutions that balance idealism with real-world constraints
- **Performance first**: Every millisecond counts in user experience
- **Maintainable code**: Code is read more than it's written
- **Continuous learning**: Technology evolves, and so should we
- **AI augmentation**: Using AI as a force multiplier, not a replacement

## Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, I'm usually:
- Experimenting with new AI models and techniques
- Exploring cybersecurity and ethical hacking
- Contributing to open-source projects
- Staying current with web standards and emerging technologies

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in connecting with fellow developers, discussing new technologies, or exploring collaboration opportunities.
